3. Rules of the Game
Main Rules
•	The board starts with most squares colored in a default color.
•	The objective is to color all squares on the board in a specific goal color, as defined by the level.
How to Play
•	Clicking a square changes its color and the colors of its neighbors (above, below, left, and right, if applicable).
•	Neighbors outside the board boundaries are not affected.

Restarting and Customizing
•	Players can restart the current level by clicking the "Restart" button, which resets the board to its initial configuration.
•	To change the board size, players can return to the main menu and specify new dimensions (height and width). Both values must be integers. If invalid inputs are provided, an error message will appear.
Specific Level Rules
•	Level 1: The board starts fully colored in the default color.
•	Level 2: The board starts with one move already applied, partially coloring the board in the goal color.
•	Level 3: The board starts with random squares already colored in the goal color, making the game significantly harder and potentially unsolvable.

4. Game Objectives
The primary objective is to color the entire board in the goal color within the fewest possible moves. Players are encouraged to strategize and find efficient solutions to complete levels. Success is indicated with a visual form being shown.
